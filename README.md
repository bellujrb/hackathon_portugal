## 🌐 Introduction

Through our NFC tool, the user enters our game developed with computer vision for classrooms, where children learn while playing. It uses technology to recognize objects and movements, making the experience interactive. Student performance data is sent to an analytics application, which provides insights to teachers to better track and personalize teaching.
